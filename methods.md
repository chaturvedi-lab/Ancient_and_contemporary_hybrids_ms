These are just general outline and notes for what I have done so far for the Dubois hybridization project. This document has all the figures and scripts used for doing all the analysis. I will obviously keep adding more details for the methods, but I just wanted to get an idea of the methods outline as I want to repeat this analysis with only males.

I have 835 individuals from 23 populations included in this study. Here is a table of details for each population:
